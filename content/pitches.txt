1What’s In The Book In this book, you’ll find 250 “CLOSES” from the
top-converting sales videos in history. This includes webinars and video
sales letters from modern-day marketers who’ve absolutely crushed it,
including some that have done hundreds of millions in sales, like
Mindvalley, V Shred, Dr. Gundry, and more! To set expectations, don’t
try to craft a full sales pitch using only the closes found in this
book. Crafting a winning sales presentation front to back takes more
than just a swipe file. I’m just being real. What this book will do is
help you overcome the objections that naturally arise when you pitch, no
matter what you’re selling or how you pitch it. Every pitch, no matter
how good, will face objections from the listener. You’ll learn how the
top marketers in the world overcome these objections by sprinkling these
objection-crushing closes throughout their

2pitches. The good news is, these work for any offer. This means you can
elevate your pitch from good to great by incorporating these closes into
your presentation. If you want to create a winning sales presentation
from start to finish, check out my Epic Pitch Challenge. Let me expand
on why these closes are so critical… Because the unfortunate truth is,
you can say everything correctly during a sales video or sales letter,
but when you get to the part where you ask for money, it can all fall
apart! I believe this is why so many people are afraid and nervous when
they get to that part (I know I was when I started!). The truth is, say
the wrong thing and everything you just built up in their mind starts
unraveling like a cheap rug. A CLOSE is a “Magic Sentence” used in sales
pitch to turn “Maybe” into “Yes, I’ll buy.”

3When someone sticks around for your entire sales presentation and
reaches the pitch, they’re usually super interested but likely still on
the fence… That’s where these magic sentences, or “closes”, come in.
They’re designed to push them off the fence and straight into a buying
decision. That’s why it’s so critical to sprinkle them throughout your
pitch. I’m giving you 250 of the BEST closes from the highest performing
sales videos in history. Use them, and watch your sales skyrocket.

4How To Use This Book The 250+ proven closes in this book are organized
to help you overcome the objections that naturally arise in any sales
pitch. Here’s how to navigate and make the most of them: • Type: Each
close has a specific name to help you easily identify and remember it. •
Market: The original sales presentation’s market is noted. There are
three core markets: health, wealth, and happiness. • Close: This is the
word-for-word close from the original sales video, showcasing how top
marketers use it to address objections. • Why : A concise explanation of
why this close is effective and what it accomplishes in overcoming
objections. • Examples: To help you apply the close across different
markets, we’ve included two theoretical examples for the other two
markets. So if the original close is in the wealth market, you’ll find
examples in the health and happiness markets.

5Go through this book, pick your favorites, and use them throughout your
sales presentation— especially right before you ask for money and right
after. I highly suggest you model these closes and not directly copy and
paste them. Because if you just copy and paste, well, you’re a turd. A
big fat turd. Actually, maybe I’ll write a book called Big Fat Turds,
about all the worst marketing practices one can do. And if you copy and
paste, I’ll include you in it! So please model, don’t copy. Good closes
mean better money, which leads to a better lifestyle. It’s that simple.

6How Did I Find These Closes? Well, I’m Dan Henry, the founder of
GetClients. com, and I’m a total marketing nerd. Maybe it’s because I
delivered pizza for seven years, and once I started learning marketing
and sales, my life turned around fast. I won’t bore you with my “origin
story”. If you want to know how I went from a pizza boy to an 8-figure
business, you can watch this video here. In my first year of learning
this stuff, my business made $2.8 million. Since then, we’ve done over
$32 million with my own offers and over $100 million for my clients. And
most of that success comes from writing great sales presentations that
have good content, hooks, closes—all that “know what to say” stuff. In
my last book, Big Fat Hooks, I geeked out and studied HOOKS from the
top-converting sales videos ever. I looked at the best offers on
ClickBank, the Mindvalley ads and sales videos (which have done over
$300 million), and other internet marketing offers that crushed it. I
went through all the transcripts to find the best hooks.

7That book did insanely well, and people loved it. Hundreds and hundreds
of reviews came pouring in. So I thought, well, if I’m going to write a
swipe file about how to hook attention at the beginning of a
presentation, why wouldn’t I create a swipe file of all the closes you
need at the end of your presentation? And so that’s how Big Fat Pitches
was born. Now you may ask, why didn’t I call it Big Fat Closes? Well,
because then I wouldn’t get all the comments about how they thought the
book was called Big Fat Bitches. Do you see that? That’s a Big Fat
Pattern Interrupt. Maybe that’ll be my next swipe file Now, at this
point, you have two options… 1. You can manually go through all the
closes in this book and meticulously insert them into your sales
presentation. 2. Or you could just use the Big Fat Pitches tool inside
our software, Artemo, and it’ll do it for

8you in seconds. And it’ll probably do a better job, because I
personally programmed every tool. And I’m pretty good at this stuff ;)

Otherwise, enjoy the book and start creating! Cheers,

84 CYBERTRUCK VSL REPORTEDLY GENERATED MULTIPLE MILLIONS Despite its
name, the “Cybertruck VSL” by Sabri Suby is not about Tesla. Suby uses
the Cybertruck as a pattern interrupt to grab attention before diving
into the pitch. (Because nothing says “pay attention” like a truck that
looks like it was designed by a toddler with a ruler.) It’s a masterful

have been typing with one hand while doing push-ups with the other.

it. Plus, don’t worry, I listed myself twice too. Fair is fair.

136122. RESULTS LIMITATION CLOSE Market: Wealth CLOSE: “Are we
        magicians? Maybe. Will this little money printing machine make

136125. UNREALIZED POTENTIAL CLOSE Market: Wealth CLOSE: “It’s for
        brands that know deep down inside that their digital marketing

136127. PROFIT MARGIN QUALIFICATION CLOSE Market: Wealth CLOSE: “First
        up, the product you’re selling has got to have gross margins of

        good.” WHY IT’S A CLOSE: Offers autonomy while positioning
        done-for-you as premium choice. EXAMPLES: Health: “Take our
        workout plan and run with it, or let our trainers guide you
        step-by-step…” Relationships: “Use our dating strategies solo,
        or let our matchmakers do the work…”

136133. SUCCESS INFRASTRUCTURE CLOSE Market: Wealth CLOSE: “My team and
        I have hyper-obsessed and split-tested every type of offer,

136135. MARKET EVOLUTION CLOSE Market: Wealth CLOSE: “Bro, come on. I
        mean, every man and his dog has some side hustle Shopify store
        and is drop shipping some trash that they found on Alibaba. The
        market is crowded as shit…” WHY IT’S A CLOSE: Shows why old
        methods don’t work and positions new solutions. EXAMPLES:
        Health: “Everyone’s selling the same old workout programs and

136136. PERFORMANCE CONTRAST CLOSE Market: Wealth CLOSE: “While most
        folks are dealing with a never- ending shit storm of rising

136138. MARKET AWARENESS CLOSE Market: Wealth CLOSE: “You’re only
        selling to people that are already product-aware, meaning
        they’re already aware that they have a problem…That part of the

        WHY IT’S A CLOSE: Shows massive untapped opportunity being

136142. COMPETITOR IGNORANCE CLOSE Market: Wealth CLOSE: “Even some of

136145. AUTHORITY DEMOLITION CLOSE Market: Wealth CLOSE: “The reason
        that you’ve hired agencies, consultants, or employees, and
