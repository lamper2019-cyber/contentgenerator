By Dan Henry A GetClients.com guide

In this book, you’ll find 297 copywriting hooks from proven sales pages,
videos, and webinars. Why do you need these hooks? Because you can’t
sell anything if you can’t grab the attention of the person you’re
trying to sell to. With the average attention span shorter than ever,
you’ve got to capture the attention of their smartphone- fried minds
quickly. These hooks will help you do just that. Sprinkle them
throughout your sales copy, especially at the beginning. You’ll see
retention soar, and when that happens, your sales will skyrocket too.
Better copy means better money, which leads to a better lifestyle. It’s
that simple. How did I find these hooks? Well, I’m Dan Henry, the
founder of getclients.com, and I’m a total marketing nerd, especially
when it comes to copywriting. Maybe it’s because I delivered pizza for
seven years, and once I started learning copy, my life turned around
fast.

In my first year of mastering copy, my business made $2.8 million. Since
then, we’ve done over $32 million with my own offers and over $100
million for my clients. And most of that success comes from writing
great copy for sales videos, ads, emails, and sales pages—all that good
marketing stuff. So, I decided to geek out and study the top- converting
sales videos ever. I looked at the best offers on ClickBank, the
Mindvalley ads and sales videos (which have done over $300 million), and
other internet marketing offers that crushed it. I went through all the
transcripts to find the best hooks. Each hook in this book comes from
one of those top-performing offers, with a quick explanation of why it’s
effective, plus two examples of how you can use it for a different
offer. So, there are actually 891 hooks in this book! I don’t suggest
you just copy and paste these hooks—that would make you someone I’d
never want to be friends with. Instead, use them as

inspiration for your offers or your clients’ offers. To make this even
easier, I’ve developed my own AI copywriting software, Artemo. You could
sift through the nearly 1,000 hooks in this book, or you could use
Artemo to do it for you in seconds. Artemo can write all your sales
pages, videos, social media scripts, emails, email sequences, podcast
outreach emails, cold emails, tweets, reel scripts, and more. You can
use it for your business or your clients’ businesses. Click here to get
a demo of Artemo Otherwise, enjoy the book and start creating. Cheers,
